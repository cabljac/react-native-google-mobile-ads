# RewardedAd
 
 A class for interacting and showing Rewarded Ads.
 
 An Rewarded advert can be pre-loaded and shown at a suitable point in your apps flow, such as at the end of a level
in a game. The content of a rewarded advert can be controlled via your Google Mobile Ads dashboard. Typically users are rewarded
after completing a specific advert action (e.g. watching a video or submitting an option via an interactive form).
Events (such as the user earning a reward or closing a rewarded advert early) are sent back for you to handle accordingly
within your application.

#### Example

First create a new Rewarded instance, passing in your Ad Unit ID from the Google Mobile Ads configuration console, and any additional
request options. The example below will present a test advert, and only request a non-personalized ad.

```js
import { RewardedAd, TestIds } from 'react-native-google-mobile-ads';

const rewarded = RewardedAd.createForAdRequest(TestIds.REWARDED, {
    requestNonPersonalizedAdsOnly: true,
});
 ```

Each advert needs to be loaded from Google Mobile Ads before being shown. It is recommended this is performed before the user
reaches the checkpoint to show the advert, so it's ready to go. Before loading the advert, we need to setup
event listeners to listen for updates from Google Mobile Ads, such as advert loaded or failed to load.

Event types match the `AdEventType` or `RewardedAdEventType` interface. The potential user reward for rewarded
adverts are passed back to the event handler on advert load and when the user earns the reward.

```js
import { RewardedAdEventType } from 'react-native-google-mobile-ads';

rewarded.onAdEvent((type, error, reward) => {
  if (type === RewardedAdEventType.LOADED) {
    rewarded.show();
  }
  if (type === RewardedAdEventType.EARNED_REWARD) {
    console.log('User earned reward of ', reward);
  }
});

rewarded.load();
 ```

The rewarded advert will be presented to the user, and several more events can be triggered such as the user clicking the
advert, closing it or completing the action.
